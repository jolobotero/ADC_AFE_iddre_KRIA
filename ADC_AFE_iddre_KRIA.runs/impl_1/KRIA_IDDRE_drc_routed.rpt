AVAL-168#1 Critical Warning
MMCM_ADV Phase shift and divide attr checks  
The MMCME4_ADV cell MMCME3_BASE_inst has a CLKFBOUT_PHASE value (150.000)  with CLKFBOUT_USE_FINE_PS set to FALSE. It should be a multiple of [45 / CLKFBOUT_MULT_F] = [45 / 2.000] = 22.500. Please update the design to use a valid value.
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
21 out of 21 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: DCLK_n, DCLK_p, Data_n, Data_out[13:0], Data_p, FCLK_n, FCLK_p, Rst.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
21 out of 21 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: DCLK_n, DCLK_p, Data_n, Data_out[13:0], Data_p, FCLK_n, FCLK_p, Rst.
